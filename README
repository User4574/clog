PHP blogging software

I wanted an exceptionally small piece of blogging software, where each post was simply a file, the title was the filename and the date was the modified time.

This is that piece of software.

Installation (Apache):
* Clone the repo
* Create a posts directory
* Move settings.sample to settings.php and configure it
* Create a .htpasswd file for posting users
* Create an Apache virtual host or .htaccess file based on htaccess.sample
* (Optional) delete .sample files

Instructions (nginx):
* Clone the repo
* Create a posts directory
* Move settings.sample to settings.php and configure it
* Create a .htpasswd file for posting users
* Create an nginx server based on nginx.sample
* (Optional) delete .sample files
