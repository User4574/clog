PHP blogging software

User4574 wanted an exceptionally small piece of blogging software, where each post was simply a file, the title was the filename and the date was the modified time.

This is that piece of software.

Installation (Apache):
* Clone the repo
* Create a posts directory
* Move settings.sample to settings.php and configure it
* Create a .htpasswd file for posting users
* Create an Apache virtual host or .htaccess file based on htaccess.sample
* (Optional) delete .sample files

Nginx instructions removed, not tested on ngingx. for these instructions see User4574's version here: https://github.com/User4574/clog

Recent changes:

-Added inline mode to widget file (?inlinemode=1)
-Removed the redirect on posts directory
-Changed all css stuff to prevent other possible css conflicts
