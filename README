PHP blogging software

User4574 wanted an exceptionally small piece of blogging software, where each post was simply a file, the title was the filename and the date was the modified time.

This is that piece of software.

Installation (Apache):
* Clone the repo
* Create a posts directory
* Move settings.sample to settings.php and configure it
* Create a .htpasswd file for posting users
* Create an Apache virtual host or .htaccess file based on htaccess.sample
* (Optional) delete .sample files
* Run the updatels.php file (navigate to this file in your web browser) or create a blank .lsout file.

Nginx instructions removed, not tested on nginx. for these instructions see User4574's version here: https://github.com/User4574/clog

Recent changes:

-Added basic security to the posting system to stop users uploading executable files like "run_this_file_to_murder_this_server.php" :-)
-Added options for fancy/ugly url modes and show or hide posts link in header
-Added inline mode to widget file (?inlinemode=1)
-Removed the redirect on posts directory
-Changed all css stuff to prevent other possible css conflicts
